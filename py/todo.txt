perhaps manually render text to screen character by character
to be able to control and know where each character is, so 
that it is easier to align the cursor, space them out 
align the "human readable" cursor


figure out how to reprogram the arduino to remove the 50 keystroke limit

add a cursor to the tm location in the encoding and the human readable

update the decoding of bits to human readable to be simpler

add scrolling

increase number of bits?

recover from typos 

make git repo so code is not lost


incorporate a stop ('q') button into arduino controller 

going right or left over the right and left boundary should 
go to the line above or below as appropriate
